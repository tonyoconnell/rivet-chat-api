Certainly! Below are the shell commands tailored for macOS to accomplish the tasks you've outlined. Please ensure that you have the necessary software installed on your macOS system, such as Docker, Supabase CLI, Node.js for npm, and Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extensions for remote debugging.

### Server

**Start Docker:**

To start Docker on macOS, you typically use the Docker Desktop application. However, if you prefer to start Docker from the command line, you can use the following command. Note that Docker Desktop must be installed first.

```shell
open -a Docker
```

This command opens the Docker Desktop application, which starts the Docker engine.

### Database

**Start Supabase:**

To start your Supabase local development setup, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

```shell
supabase start
```

Ensure you have the Supabase CLI installed and are in the root directory of your Supabase project.

### Code

**Start Chat UI:**

Navigate to the directory of your Chat UI project where the `package.json` file is located. Then, run:

```shell
npm run chat
```

This command assumes that you have a script named `chat` defined in your `package.json` file that starts your Chat UI application.

### Visual Studio Code

**Press "Run -> Start Debugging":**

Starting the debugging process in Visual Studio Code typically involves using the GUI. However, you can open your project in Visual Studio Code with the following command:

```shell
code .
```

After opening your project, you would manually navigate to "Run -> Start Debugging" or use the shortcut `F5` to start debugging.

### Rivet

**Select Remote Debugger:**

For Rivet or similar applications that require selecting options like "Remote Debugger," you would typically need to interact with the application's GUI. If Rivet has CLI commands or is integrated into Visual Studio Code, you would follow the specific instructions or shortcuts provided by the application. Unfortunately, there's no standard shell command for interacting with GUI elements like menus and buttons in applications without CLI support for those actions.

---

Remember, for GUI actions in applications like Docker Desktop, Visual Studio Code, and Rivet, shell commands can launch or open these applications, but further interactions often require manual input unless the application provides specific CLI commands or API endpoints for automation.
